1. Typescript is strongly typed language. If you define type string at specific variable, then this var is string type.

2.Type-Inference:
If you assign number in specific variable,then this var is number type,you can not assign any other type in this variable.

3.const variable:
use const where variable values do not change.

4.let is used for block scoping.

e.g.
let z=0;
if (true) {
	var z = 4;
	//use z
}
else {
	var z = "string";
	//use z
}
console.log("let: " + z);//ans is 4,Error: z is not defined in this scope


5.Arrays:
let array1 : number[] = [5, 6, 7]; //correct syntax
let array2:Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];//alternative correct syntax
let array3 : number[] = [];//correct syntax to define an empty array

//let array4: number[] = new number[2];//error

let array5: number[] = []; //this is empty array
array5.push(1,2,3,4); //dynamically adding
console.log(array5[1]); //ans is 2


6.Any Type:
If you define any type to any variable, then you can assign multiple type to this variable.
If you define any type to any variable, then you can assign or reduce a property from object.


7.Explicit Casting:

let myType = <any> { name: "Zia", id: 1 };
let myType1 = { name: "Zia", id: 1 } as any;//this is an alternative syntax for casting
-----------------------------------
let b = a as string;//Error
-----------------------------------

8.Enums:
An enumeration is a collection/list of numeric value constants which has different meaningful human readable names/identifiers and it is created by a keyword “enum”.
It defines the state of object property.
It also returns property against index no.

e.g. enum Color {
	Red, Green, Blue
};  //starts with 0
var c: Color = Color.Green;
console.log(c); // ans is 1.


enum Color1 {
	Red = 1, Green, Blue
};
var colorName: string = Color1[2]; //it is string type because it returns the state and it is string.
console.log(colorName); //ans is Green


enum Color2 {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4}; //can assign values to all

var colorIndex = Color2[3]; 
console.log(colorIndex); // ans is undefined

var colorIndex1 = Color2["Blue"]; 
console.log(colorIndex1); // ans is 4



9.Const Enums:
The const enum members can not be accessed through their numeric values such as ConstEnumName[0],
 they only be accessed using string literals such as ConstEnumName[“NamedValue”].

but it can access like this:

const enum Color2 {Red = 1, Green = 2, Blue = 4};//can assign values to all
var colorIndex = Color2["Blue"];
console.log(colorIndex);


10. Optional Parameter:
In optional parameter, if you declare 3 params and the 3rd para is optional.
Then if you return only 2 para, it will be correct because 3rd para is optional. 


11. Default Parameter:
In default parameter, we add a default parameter if you not assign the value in this parameter.
The default value is assign on that parameter.

12.Rest Parameter:
The rest parameter is an array which receives the arguments, store them into index order (start from 0) and access them through a loop.

//Note: Rest, optional and default parameters can only be at the end of the parameter list


13.Lambda Expression:
var add = (a: number, b: number) => {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add);



var add1 = (x: number, y: number) => (x + y);
console.log(add1);
//output var add1 = function(x, y){return x + y};



var myFunction = f => { this.x = "x"; }//automatically creating the that-equals-this pattern
console.log(myFunction);
/*
When compiled, TypeScript automatically makes sure this points to my class instead of the enclosed function:
var _this = this;
var myFunction = function(f) { _this.x = "x"; };
*/											


14.Callback Function:

A callback function is a function which is passed from another function as its parameter.
A callback function is passed from a normal function as an argument in order to invoke it.



15.OverLoaded Function:

Multiple functions with the same name can be defined in TypeScript and that process is called overloaded functions.
In function overloading process, we can define multiple functions with the same name but their parameter-list might be different from each other by number, data types and sequence and their return type also would be different from each other.

Note: At the end of overloaded functions, another function with the same name must be defined with its body/implementation and it must be marked with “any” as its return type.


16. Union Type:

In union type, you can define multiple types(e.g number,string,boolean) in single variable. 

e.g. var a: string | number | boolean;


/*Note on Type Guards:
A common pattern in JavaScript is to use "typeof" or "instanceof" to examine the type of an expression at runtime. 
TypeScript now understands these conditions and will change type inference accordingly when used in an if block.
This is called a type guard.



17. Type Aliases:

In type aliases, you can define multiple types with "type" keyword and this type is assign in a variable. So, that variable use these types.

e.g
type StringNumberOrBoolean = string | number | boolean;
type PrimitiveArray = Array<string|number|boolean>;
type MyNumber = number;

18.Tuples:
Tuple types have the advantage that you can accurately describe the type of an array of mixed types at specific index no.




****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

19.a. Classes and Objects:

A class just is a template, the blue print, the definition, the logical abstraction, an idea that only defines the form of an object.Example of classes (Mark sheet, User, Bank account, Button, Date, Media player etc.). 
It is like a wrapper which defines the attributes and behavior inside it. 

The object is a thing which is a real creation or implementation of a class (means physical creation of a class), which has physical existence.
It is an instance of a class.

The duck typing concept is also apply on classes and object.

In typescript, 
min properties of class object=max properties of class object  //Allowed  
max properties of class object=min properties of class object  //Not Allowed

19.b,c. Classes Duck typing:

Private members are only accessible within their declaring class.
Protected members are only accessible within their declaring class and classes derived from it.
Public members can be accessed anywhere.
A class is a user defined type.


20.a. Inheritance:

In TypeScript only multilevel inheritance is supported which means we can inherits only one base class for derived class at a time and cannot inherits more than one/multiple base classes into a single derived class at a time.
Derived class must have same properties as base class

If you inherit child class to base class, then you should include the base class's property in child class with "super" keyword.


20.b. Abstract Class:

In programming languages, an abstract class is a generic class (or type of object) used as a basis for creating specific objects that conform to its protocol, or the set of operations it supports. Abstract classes are not instantiated directly. 

Abstract classes are useful when creating hierarchies of classes that model reality because they make it possible to specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods, 
but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class (a derived class) is needed.

We can not create instance of abstract class.

20.c. Constructors:

It is a special type of function which has no return type even void.
It can be declared with a “constructor” keyword.
It is called from outside the class.
In TypeScript, multiple constructors are not allowed in a class.	
Multiple supper call working.
A constructor is called automatically when we create an object of a class.

24.Acessors:

Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component. 
It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building an impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption.


Interfaces:

An Interface defines the term “what a class must do”. It enforces to the class to complete the uncompleted behavior (functions) and attributes (properties).
An object of the interface cannot be created.
An interface defines the shape of our class or object.
There are no any complete function can be declared in an interface.
One interface can be implemented by any number of classes and also one class can implements any number of interfaces at once separated by commas.
Static member can not declare in interface.

If a class implements an interface, it must have the properties as declare in an interface.
But class can add a property in it.
																

Static Property:

Whenever you want to access methods of a class (but the method of the class is not static), then it is necessary to create an object of that class. 
But if the static keyword is used with a member function (method), that method is automatically invoked without creating an object of the class.
You just invoke that method using the class name .(dot) method name.
